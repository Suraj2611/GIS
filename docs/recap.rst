Recap

In the previous sessions on GIS, the main topics we discussed were:
 - `What is a GIS? <http://gis.washington.edu/phurvitz/professional/SSI/whatis.html>`_ What are its uses?
 - An early example of spatial analysis, and its practical use: `John Snow's cholera map <http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/john-snow-cholera-map>`_ 
 - Types of spatial data: This `webpage <http://gis.washington.edu/phurvitz/professional/SSI/datatype.html>`_ very nicely summarizes the discussion we had. 
 - Uses of GIS:
 
  + `A post <https://www.gislounge.com/basic-uses-of-gis/>`_ on some types of spatial analysis made possible by a GIS
  +  `67 uses of GIS <http://grindgis.com/blog/gis-applications-uses>`_ for the true GIS enthusiast :P

 - An interesting paper on this topic can be found `here. <http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/205586/2/spatialcorrelation_AAEA.pdf>`_ 
 - Related Concepts (Source: `GIS Dictionary <http://support.esri.com/en/knowledgebase/GISDictionary/term/Tobler%27s%20First%20Law%20of%20Geography>`_ ) :
 
  + Spatial Autocorrelation: A measure of the degree to which a set of spatial features and their associated data values tend to be clustered together in space (positive spatial autocorrelation) or dispersed (negative spatial autocorrelation).
  + Tobler's First Law of Geography: A formulation of the concept of spatial autocorrelation by the geographer Waldo Tobler (1930-), which states "Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."
