Recap

In the previous sessions on GIS, the main topics we discussed were:
- `What is a GIS? <http://gis.washington.edu/phurvitz/professional/SSI/whatis.html>`_ What are its uses?
- An early example of spatial analysis, and its practical use: `John Snow's cholera map <http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/john-snow-cholera-map>`_
- Types of data - This `webpage <http://gis.washington.edu/phurvitz/professional/SSI/datatype.html>`_ very nicely summarizes the discussion we had.
