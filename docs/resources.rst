While we will go through the basics as much as possible, some excellent resources are available online in case you wish to take a quick
refresher/ get a head start on some of the content for the workshop bit. 

- `A Gentle Introduction to QGIS <http://docs.qgis.org/2.8/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/>`_ : Goes through the basics of GIS in detail, and also introduces important concepts and terms. We will go through some of these in detail. 
- `Projections and Coordinate Systems <https://courses.washington.edu/gis250/lessons/projection/#top>`_ : It is always useful to know about projections and coordinate systems, as they form the basis for how a GIS can store, analyze, and display spatial data. This will especially help us handle spatial data from various (and often random) sources, and allow us to work with them easily. 
- `QGIS Tutorials <http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/>`_ : This website has detailed tutorials on several topics; some of these will be covered in the session. The resources page on the website has a lot of useful links too.
