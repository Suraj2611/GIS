Workshop/ DIY Exercises
========================


- Please form groups around your tables. 
- Each group should have at least 2-3 laptops with QGIS installed
- We'll do one example which will be a "follow-along" type, and then there will be time for a DIY set of exercises. 
- Depending on team, groups can quickly present their work at the end of the session. 
- The aim is to get familiar with the following:

 +  Converting datasets  to spatial formats
   +  Attaching data to existing shapefiles (requires MMQGIS plugin)
   +  Using CSVs/ text files in QGIS. 
   +  Why not Google Earth? What are the drawbacks?
 +  Vector Styling
   +  Single Symbol
   +  Categorized
   +  Graduated
   + Rule Based Styling
 +  Working with Heatmaps
 +  Pring Composer
 +  Random Sampling of points
   +  Without Stratification
   +  With Stratification
